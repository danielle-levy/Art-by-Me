      <p><strong>What was hard to do?</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>Firstly, learning everything (practically) from scratch was very time consuming and frustrating at times</li>
        <li>I struggled with deciding on a design for the website and then implementing my vision</li>
        <li>Afterwards, backend-wise learning on sessions, cookies and databases was a struggle</li>
        <li>Deciding on a properly fitted database led us to change our first decision of a database into mongoDB</li>
        <li>Implementing my ideas for the added features (pick color & image to art) was more challenging than i thought</li>
        <li>But all in all I felt that working on this project was very satisfying and fulfilling!</li>
        <li>I had a lot of fun working on it! thank your opportunity and your guidance!</li>
      </ul>
      </p>

      <p><strong>Who is your partner?</strong>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>name and id:</strong> Ron Ben Shimon 205633845</li>
      <li><strong>What did I do?</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>All of the frontend was my responsibility: from deciding on a design to implementing my vision by studying HTML and CSS and making my vision come true.
            The Menu design and making it on a single file that is called on every page was also my responsibility</li>
          <li>Also, all of my drawings here are my doing :)</li>
          <li>I was also responsible for the ideas of the additional features, learning how to make them work and implementing them from scratch</li>
          <li>Later on I have learned how to work with MongoDB and replaced the original database making it work with cookies and sessions</li>
          <li>Building the logic of the link between the front to the server and database - add/remove to cart functionality for example</li>
          <li>Changing our first decision of a database into mongoDB and making sure it works with sessions, cookies and user managment</li>
          <li>Implementing my ideas for the added features (pick color & image to art) both back and front</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
        <li>
          <strong>What did My Partner do?</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>Firstly designed the backend architecture and made a template of it</li>
            <li>Learned about several databases and chose the most suitable one for us after also installing an initial database and making the basis for our user management system.</li>
            <li>Responsibility for the website's security and protection against DOS attacks</li>
            <li>Responsibility for testing the server side and the functionality of most features</li>
            <li>Responsibility for persistent data functionality and logic</li>
            <li>Responsibility for the initial cookies and sessions learning, functionality and performance</li>
        </li>
            </ul>
          <li>
          <strong>Both of us are responsible for</strong>
    </li>
          <ul>
            <li>Creating the following pages together: login, register, shopping cart, purchases</li>
            <li>Creating the models for the databases (modules)</li>
            <li>Both of us were very into the project and had a lot of fun working together :)</li>
            </li>
          </ul>
      </ul>
